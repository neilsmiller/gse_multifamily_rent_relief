On March 23, the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) [announced](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Moves-to-Provide-Eviction-Suspension-Relief-for-Renters-in-Multifamily-Properties.aspx) that enterprise-backed multifamily mortgages would be eligible for loan forbearance, with one condition being that tenants who have been impacted by coronavirus could not be evicted.

Per our calculations, and the press releases from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this step could extend protections to tens of millions of renters across the country.
